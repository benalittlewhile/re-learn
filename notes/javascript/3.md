# 3: object basics

## 1: definitions and basics

Objects are sets of key-value pairs where the value can be of any type included
in js (including also object). They look a little like this

```javascript
const Ben = {
  lettersInName: 3,
  favoritePokemon: "Yamper",
  likesJS: true,
  opinions: {
    Zoe: "love",
    James: "like",
    Nate: "like",
    Charlie: "like",
    Eric: "like",
  },
  dog: undefined,
  timeUntil23: null,
};
```

Note the commas: objects are sets of properties, the properties are simply
created instead of assigned, so we don't end their lines with `;`.

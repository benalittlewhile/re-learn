# 3: object basics

## 1: definitions and basics

Objects are sets of key-value pairs where the value can be of any type included
in js (including also object). They look a little like this

```javascript
const Ben = {
  lettersInName: 3,
  favoritePokemon: "Yamper",
  likesJS: true,
  opinions: {
    Zoe: "love",
    James: "like",
    Nate: "like",
    Charlie: "like",
    Eric: "like",
  },
  dog: undefined,
  timeUntil23: null,
};
```

Note the commas: objects are sets of properties, the properties are simply
created instead of assigned, so we don't end their lines with `;`.

Object properties can be deleted using the `delete` keyword.

### computed properties

Many times it will be convenient (though, thanks to ts, absolutely improper) to
dynamically assign the name of a property on an object. We do this by
surrounding the property name with `[]`.

```javascript

let pokemon = "Yamper";

const pokemons = {
  [pokemon] = "best"
}

console.log(pokemons?.Yamper); // logs "best"
```

You can think of it as a shorthand for creating a property at a string key using
bracket notation.

And of course, the whole statement inside the square brackets is evaluated,
meaning we can use any of the tricks we've seen so far, provided they return a
string (but everything can cast to a string somehow, so go wild).

### property-value shorthand

if we have variables and we want to create an object with properties where the
key is the name of the variable and the value is the value of the variable, we
can just add the variable in the object.

```javascript

const isFruit = true;

const banana = {
  isFruit
};

console.log(banana.isFruit); // logs true
```

All property accesses are valid, meaning that accessing a property that doesn't
exist on an object returns undefined. Since that check and comparing the value
to undefined to create a boolean is so common, we can instead use the `in`
keyword to check whether a property is part of an object.

```javascript
const Ben = {
  favoritePokemon: "Yamper"
}

if("favoritePokemon" in Ben) console.log(Ben.favoritePokemon); 
// unnecessary due to optional chaining, but prints "Yamper" and gets the point across

```
Naturally, we can substitute an expression to the left of the `in`, and the
expression must return a string corresponding to the property to be tested.

Iterate over the properties (that is, keys, not key-value pairs) of an object
using `for(label in object){doThing(label)}` syntax.


When iterating over objects, keys that can evaluate to integers are sorted in
ascending order, while other properties are unsorted.

tl;dr
```javascript
const smolEx = {
  15: "yes",
  Ben: "yessir",
  Allonsy: "kinda",
  0: "0",
};

for (let key in smolEx) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${smolEx[key]}`);
}

```
The above prints keys in the order 0, 15, Ben, Allonsy, so sorted
integer-convertible keys first, then remainders as-is.

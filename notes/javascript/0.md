# A note on structure

I'll organize this by topic in the form of [ch num].md and [ch num].ts files
respectively. This should not backfire in any way, and will absolutely be a
structure suitable for extended topics to stand the test of time.

(also I'm skipping making one for ch 1 unless it matters more than I'm
expecting)

Ooh, also these topics should be small enough that vertical-splitting notes and
code should not present a problem. Please read that as a guideline, because I
have no idea how to phrase it as one.

# A brief summary of the pre-chapter

Javascript is an interpreted\* language originally designed to run in web
browsers for the purpose of adding functionality to websites.

It's called javascript because when it was first released there was an
advertising push to associate it with Java. Thank God this is not actually what
happened, js has practically nothing to do with Java.

This tutorial is phrased to primarily explain js by way of running in the web.
In such cases, we can access developer tools by hitting f12 in most browsers.

cool, I think that covers most of it.

oops missed a spot: not every js feature is compatible with every browser, thus
it's good to have a [compatibility checker](caniuse.com) on-hand when writing js.

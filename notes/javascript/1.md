## 4: Variables

`use strict` is implied in classes and modules, which in my case means I've been
using it unknowingly for a good while.

declare variables using `let`

```javascript
let thisVar = "a variable";
```

we can do multiple assignments on one line (don't tho)

```javascript
let first = 1,
  second = "two",
  third = { value: "third" };
```

ah, even prettier knows better, and moves it to separate lines

valid variable name characters in js are [0-9][a-z][A-Z][_,$], and variables
can't start with digits. $name and \_name are (nominally) fine though.

Constants named with capitals are traditionally reserved for values known before
run-time (hardcoded or otherwise static), while constants named according to
another convention are set during run-time.

## 5: Data Types

JS values and variables are typed\*, according to one of 8 types. Lemme see if I
have them offhand:

object - key-value map, where the value can be of any type and the key can
usually be of most types.

string - set of encoded characters... actually here's a tangent:

oh, binary to hex is: 8 bits can be represented as 2 hex characters, and if we
go the other way then 2 hex characters is one byte. 4 bits = 2^4 = 16 possible
values- and I'll stop there because I can count. the point being, 00001011 to
hex would be 0x0b.

number - works as expected, however there are a few special values to be aware
of

- Infinity - greater than any other number
- -Infinity - less than any other number
- NaN - not a number

also, numbers go 0 to +-2^53 - 1 = 9007199254740991, which is a constant as MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

bigint - for values bigger than the above

symbol - unique values, elaboration to be added

boolean - no way that's true

null - specifically nothing or empty

undefined - not defined

null == undefined is true, so..

`typeof null => "object"`, for whatever that's worth. Apparently this is regarded
as a bug that has now been codified.

Whereas `typeof undefined => "undefined"`

js has 7 primitives: everything that isn't object.

## 6: alert, prompt, confirm

- alert(message): shows a browser-specific message box for the given string until a user
  clicks the okay button

- prompt(title, default?): request a value from the user and return it. Optional
  default value/input for the text box. Returns null if canceled.

  - if you don't supply a default then ie replaces the default with "undefined"
    which is... not null, and very not helpful.

- confirm(string): shows a modal with Okay and Cancel buttons, returns the
  boolean value associated with the selection.

  > actually, can I break this?

  > no, and I don't think it's worth the time to dig into trying.

by way of summary:

- alert() shows a text box

- prompt() shows a text box with a single-line text input field

- confirm() shows a modal with okay and cancel buttons

## 7: conversions

converting a non-numeric string to a number results in NaN

converting _any_ non-empty string (including "0") to boolean returns true

## 8: basic operators + math

negative numbers are, e.g `x = -2`

js has 6 mathematical operators:

- \+
- \-
- \*
- /
- \*\*
- %

In a grand tradition, the addition operator concatenates strings if either of
the operands _immediately adjacent to it_ is a string. e.g, `2 + 2 + '1'` will
read left to right and add the 2s, then concatenate the result with the 1
because it is a string.

The `+` operator also converts a value to a number using the same logic as
Number(x)

`+` only does this when it has no left operand, so if we want to convert then
add we have to do silly such as `+"1" + +"6"`

the above works because unary plus (i.e converting to a number) has a higher
**precedence** than addition (15 > 12, for the curious)

All operators in js return a value. This includes the `=` operator. This means
that

```javascript
let c = (a = 3);

const d = c - 2;
return d;
```

will return 3, as d has the value of c - 2- nevermind you know how arithmetic
works. We can use this effect to perform logic on whether or not an assignment succeeds.

```javascript
if ((c = getThing())) {
  dostuff();
}
```

will not run when getThing returns a falsy value.

`++` and `--` are increment and decrement operators respsectively. `++c` will
increment c in-place. Putting them before a variable returns the variable after
the change, e.g `c = 2; a = ++c;` will result in a=3, whereas `c = 2; a = c++;`
will result in c = 3 and a = 2;

js _can_ do bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.), but... I hope to never
do that.

the `,` operator performse several operations, returning the result of the last
one. It has **lower precedence** than the `=` operator, so be careful with that.

## 9: Comparisons

Comparison operators `<, >, ==, ===, !=, et al.` perform the associated
comparison on the operands on either side, then return a boolean value
containing the result. This is interesting to me right now because it means

```javascript
return (5 > 4) + 1;
```

returns 2, because 5 > 4 == true and Number(true) = 1

js compares strings letter by letter. Lower case has a lower value than upper
case, so I suppose this is using an ascii table somewhere behind the scenes.

> Note: Capital letters come first in ascii tables so a > A and b > a

\_When converting values of different types, **JS converts the values to numbers**

two nominally similar values of different types can evaluate as boolean
differently. `"0"` will evaluate to true because it is a non-empty string,
whereas 0 will be false because it is a falsy value.

`0 == false => true`, but `0 === false => false`, because type checking.
Non-type-safe comparisons cast to boolean first, where as === won't.

`null == undefined => true`, `null === undefined => false`

When we do math or make a numerical `<, >, <=, >=` comparison with null and undefined:

- null becomes `0`

  - **this is not the case for == or !=**, only the mathematical comparisons
    convert null to 0. For == and !=, null and undefined are _only_ equal to
    each other.

    ```javascript
    null == 0; // false, because 0 is not undefined and null is only equal to undefined
    null >= 0; // true, because it converts to 0
    undefined == 0; // false, undefined == [null, undefined] ONLY
    undefined > 0; // false, undefined becomes NaN when converted to a number
    ```

- undefined becomes `NaN`
  - of note, NaN returns false for all comparisons always, whereas null is 0 in
    some cases.

## 10: Conditional branching with if and ?

the `?` is used specifically for conditional assignment and has low precedence,
so while we don't technically need parentheses in `a = (b == 2) ? 'yes' : 'no'`,
you should still put them there

### Chaining ? operators

```javascript
if (thing == 2) {
  // do
} else if (thing == 3) {
  // doelse
} else if (thing == 4) {
  // doelseelse
} else {
  // dofinal
}
```

can be expressed as (and this is gross in my head so pardon mistakes)

```javascript
(thing == 2) ? do :
  (thing == 3) ? doElse :
  (thing == 4) ? doElseElse :
  final
```

> Using ? as a replacement for if in this way is difficult to read, try not to
> do it. That is, try to only use ? for conditional assignment.

Here's an example from an exercise in the tutorial

```javascript
const userAnswer = prompt("What is the 'official' name of JS?");
if (userAnswer.toLowerCase() == "Ecmascript".toLowerCase()) {
  alert("Correct");
} else {
  alert("incorrect");
}

// the bad way would be

// this is clever, but not useful. Do not do this.
prompt("What is... ?") == "Ecmascript" ? alert("correct") : alert("incorrect");
```

The bottom is clever, and it _may_ be fun to write, but don't. Future you and
everyone else will hit friction on it.

airbnb says do not nest ternaries, it's gross. Similarly, prettier makes them
gross if you nest them. ⛔ 🐦

## 11: Operators

`||` is _or_
(anything but false) || (anything but also false) => true
false || false => false

if an operand is not boolean it converts to boolean

we can use `||` to do some nifty assignment tricks, e.g

```javascript
a = false || 0 || true; // => true
```

The statements in the `or` chain are evaluated left to right. If any of them
returns a result that boolean-coverts to true then the value is returned and the
chain stops. That is,

```javascript
b = "" || true || 0; // => true, execution stops at the non-false value
```

If all operands evaluate to false, the chain returns the last operand. That is,
if the last operand is 0 the chain will return 0, _not false_.

`||` can be used similarly to an if statement in that if the value to the left
is falsey the statement to the right will be executed, i.e `false || doThing();`. This is clever, so do not do it.

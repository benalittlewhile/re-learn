# So I'm doing a learn

## Step 0.5: A form

Christian suggested that I practice a technique ascribed to a Cal-Tech person,
that being:

> 1: learn
> 2: teach what you learned

## Step 1: What am I trying to learn?

- JS (again)
  - Async/Await (better)
- React (more)
- Markdown (kinda)

## Step 2: how do I learn?

Well... the first step to nearly anything is trying it.
That's what I'm doing here with markdown, and it's kinda nice so far I have to
admit.

is it 2 breaks fo- yeah it is okay

~~so this works as intended?~~ It do!!

    so. Time to try everything in markdown a few times
    does this
    is this a code block or
    edit: yes, this is a code block because it's preceded by 4 spaces

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log("ooh, pretty code example");
}
```

is this one just
is this indented

> indent? no! quote!

4 spaces is a tab

```
is this
```

oooooh singles are for inline like... `javascript this is a banana`

is... can this do footnotes now?[^1] yes it can

[^1]: yes it can

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

# So what have I Learned

Well... for one thing, `vim` + markdown is actually insane as far as styling and
sequencing content for ~~the web~~ subsequent reading. I can see why a
generation of developers got used to a workflow centering around it. Similarly,
I'm excited that a new wave of developers, and especially non-developers are
getting into markdown with tools like obsidian and notion. This is going to be
so much fun to get good at and learn more.

first thing:

- \# is for headers
- \## is for smaller headings

- apparently - has to be the first character in the line and have a space after
  it, but after that it will happily make a bulleted item

- \*\* will do bold text

  - so will \_\_

- \> are quotes, like I've seen them in discord and slack a-
  > wait a hot effing second, is discord just a markdown renderer? Are we being
  > lied to this entire time?

some interesting combinations of characters going on in the above, apparently a
quote under a bullet will be forced to indent.

> but a quote under no modifier has no such limitations

okay. So I've got how this is going to work, now I need a way to organize my
notes.
I'm thinking... well first:

- **links** are \[]() pairs

I'm thinking I'd like to part this out by topic on
[javascript.info](https://javascript.info), provided that's not a problematic
way. I'm sure as hell not _intending_ to do separate npm packages for each
(though admittedly the thought crosses my mind to reimplement all of this in
typescript)
